# ComputerVisionExercise

In this repository I will be contributing all the necessary tools with better code explanation regarding OpenCV and its application.

## Image Transformations
This folder contains all the image transformations related functions and libraries in OpenCV.

1. Image Flipping.
2. Image Rotation.
3. Shifting Images.

## Important color scaling
It contains all the scaling features of openCV.

1. Canny.
2. Gaussian Blur.
3. GrayScale.

## Some reallife implementations
This folder contains all the real life implementation that I have done using OpenCV.

1. motion detection.

## Basic reading and rescaling
This folder contains all the basic reading and rescaling technique in OpenCV.

1. cv2 reading image.
2. cv2 reading videos.
3. cv2 resize and rescale.
4. cv2 resizing.
5. cv2 webcam.

## Draw and write on images.
This folder contains drawing in a blank canvas or creating a bounding box in the detected place.

1. Draw.

## resources
This folder contains images and video used for all the programs.

1. Images.
2. Videos.

These are some of the fundamentals of this repository.
Hope it helps somebody who is exploring OpenCV and ended up here.

## happy coding.
