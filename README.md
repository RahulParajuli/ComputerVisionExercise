# ComputerVisionExercise

In this repository I will be contributing all the necessary tools with better code explanation regarding OpenCV and its application.

## Basic Exercise folder contains all the basic components of open CV.

Also I will also be doing some real life implementation of open CV to some extent.

## real life implementation will contain all the practices done using OpenCV.

These are some of the fundamentals of this repository.
Hope it helps somebody who is exploring this.

# happy coding.
